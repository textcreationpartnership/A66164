            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince I laſt met you, I have uſed My beſt Endeavours to Reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> into ſuch a Condition this Year, as that it might be no longer a Charge to <hi>England.</hi> And it has pleaſed God to bleſs My Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with ſuch Succeſs, that I doubt not, but I ſhould have been fully poſſeſt of that Kingdom by this time, had I been Enabled to have gone into the Field as ſoon as I ſhould have done, and as is more eſpecially Neceſſary in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Rains are ſo great, and begin ſo early.</p>
            <p>I think My Self obliged to take Notice, how well the Army there have behaved themſelves on all Occaſions, and born great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips with little Pay, and with ſo much Patience and Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as could not proceed but from an Affectionate Duty to My Service, and a Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>I have already made it evident, how much I have preferred the Satisfaction of My Subjects before the moſt ſolid Advantages of the Crown, by parting with ſo conſiderable a Branch of its Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; And it is no leſs apparent, that I have asked no Revenue for My Self, but what I have readily ſubjected to be Charged to the Uſes of the War.</p>
            <p>I did at My Departure give Order for all the Publick Accompts to be made ready for Me againſt My Return, and I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be laid before the Houſe of Commons; by which they will ſee, that the real Want of what was neceſſary beyond the Fonds given, and the not getting in due time that for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37978:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->which Fonds were Aſſigned, have been the principal Cauſes why the Army is in ſo much Arrear of their Pay, and the Stores both for the Navy and the Ordnance not ſupplied as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>Now, as I have neither ſpared My Perſon, nor My Pains, to do you all the Good I could; ſo I doubt not, but, if you will as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do your Parts, it is in your Power to make both Me and your ſelves Happy, and the Nation Great: And on the other hand, it is too plain, by what the <hi>French</hi> have let you ſee ſo lately, that if the preſent War be not proſecuted with Vigour, no Nation in the World is expoſed to greater Danger.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore, there will need no more upon that Subject, than to Lay before you, Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, the State of what will be Neceſſary for the Support of the Fleet and Armys; which cannot poſſibly admit of being Leſſen'd in the Year enſuing; and to Recommend to your Care the Clearing of My Revenue, ſo as to Enable Me to Subſiſt, and to Maintain the Charge of the Civil Liſt; the Revenue being ſo Engaged, that it muſt be wholly Apply'd, after the Firſt of <hi>November</hi> next, to Pay off the Debts already Charged upon it: And therefore a preſent Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration muſt be had of the Arrears of the Army, which ſhall likewiſe be laid before you, and for all which I muſt deſire a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and timely Supply.</p>
            <p>It is farther Neceſſary to inform you, That the whole Support of the Confederacy abroad, will abſolutely depend upon the Speed and Vigour of your Proceedings in this Seſſion.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt take Notice, with great Satisfaction, of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs which My Subjects of all Degrees have ſhewn both in this City, and in their ſeveral Countries, by giving their Aſſiſtances ſo cheerfully as they did in My Abſence, while the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was upon Our Coaſts. And beſides this ſo convincing Mark of the good Inclinations of My People, I have found through all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where I paſſed, both at My Going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from thence, ſuch Demonſtrations of their Affection, that I have not the leaſt Doubt, but I ſhall find the ſame from their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in Parliament.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude, without taking Notice alſo, how much the Honour of the Nation has been expoſed by the ill Conduct of My Fleet, in the laſt Summers Engagement againſt the <hi>French;</hi> And I think My Self ſo much concern'd to ſee it Vindicated, that I cannot reſt ſatisfied, till an Example has been made of ſuch as ſhall be found faulty upon their Examination and Trial, which was not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable while the whole Fleet was abroad, but is now put into the proper Way of being done as ſoon as may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
               <lb/>
I look upon the future Well-being of this Kingdom, to depend upon the Reſult of your Counſels and Determinations at this time: And the Benefit will be double by the Speed of your Reſolutions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that I hope you will agree with Me in this Concluſion, <hi>That whoever goes about to obſtruct or divert your Applications to theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, preferably to all others, can neither be My Friend nor the Kingdoms.</hi>
